"""Repository abstractions for persisting job data.

This module defines an abstract base class that specifies the
interface for storing job listings. Concrete implementations can
persist data to different back ends, such as a local JSON file or a
database. Separating persistence logic from scraping and business
logic promotes adherence to the singleâ€‘responsibility principle and
facilitates testing and future extensions.
